333…3 (99 times) / 3 = 111…1 (99 times)

111 / 3 = 37 , 111000 / 3 = 37000 , 111000000 / 3 = 37000000 , …
-> 111…1 (99 times) / 3 = 370370370…37 where “37” appears 33 times. The rest of the digits are zeros. 

-> Sum of digits = (3+7) x 33 = 330. 

300 is NOT divisible by 9
-> 370370370…37 is NOT divisible by 9
->  111…1 (99 times)is NOT divisible by 27
-> 333…3 (99 times) is NOT divisible by 81
